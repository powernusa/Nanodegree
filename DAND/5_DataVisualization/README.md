# Data Visualization
This project was completed as part of the course requirements of Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) certification.

## Overview
This project has two parts that demonstrate the importance and value of data visualization techniques 
in the data analysis process. In the first part, you will use Python visualization libraries to systematically
explore a selected dataset, starting from plots of single variables and building up to plots of multiple 
variables. 

In the second part, you will produce a short presentation that illustrates interesting properties, 
trends, and relationships that you discovered in your selected dataset. 
The primary method of conveying your findings will be through transforming your exploratory 
visualizations from the first part into polished, explanatory visualizations.

## Technologies Used
- Python 
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, plotly
- Jupyter Notebook
