# Wrangle & Analyze Data
This project was completed as part of the course requirements of Udacity's [Data Analyst Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/data-analyst-nanodegree--nd002) certification.

## Overview
The project used data from the [WeRateDogs](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) Twitter account. The data was assessed, cleaned and analyzed to provide accurate insights into account follower behaviour.


The project involved gathering data using a variety of file types and gathering techniques (manual download, programmatic download, api access), assessing the data for quality and tidiness, cleaning the data using a define, code, test methodology, and completing analysis and visualzations of the cleaned datasets.

## Technologies Used
- Python 
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, json, os, requests, tweepy
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Findings
- The WeRateDogs account saw a decline in followers over approximately two years
- During the same period, total favorites received per week generally increased
- Age of the dog is less likely to influence numbers of retweets and favorites, but especially fluffy dogs receive more favorites on average
- While there is some correlation between the ratings provided by the site and corresponding retweets and favorites, there is still substantial variability across the rating spectrum
